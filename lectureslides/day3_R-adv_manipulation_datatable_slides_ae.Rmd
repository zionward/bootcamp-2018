# introduction

## what is `data.table`?

> - "`data.table` is an R package that provides an enhanced version of data.frames" 
> - "Briefly, if you are interested in reducing programming and compute time tremendously, then this package is for you." 

  > - \- [authors of `data.table`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html)

> - `data.tables` provide an alternate framework for tabular data analysis, similar to `dplyr`

## why do we care?

> - `data.table` is popular
![](figures/cran_downloads.png)
> - `data.table` performs better on large data sets
> - you might prefer the syntax and/or philosophy behind it

# `data.table` basics

## load data

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# import data.table library
library(data.table)
library(lubridate)

data_file <- here::here("data", "generation.csv")

# read in two versions of data, one as a data.frame and one as a data.table
generation_df <- read.csv(data_file, stringsAsFactors = F)

generation_dt <- fread(data_file)

```

`data.table` inherits from a `data.frame`.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

View(generation_df)
View(generation_dt)

generation_df
generation_dt

class(generation_df) # "data.frame"
class(generation_dt) # "data.table" "data.frame"

str(generation_df)
str(generation_dt)

```

## `data.frame` and `data.table` comparison

There are some major differences between the two:

> - different philosophy => different syntax
> - due to optimizations, `data.table` might perform better, particularly on large and complex data sets
> - fewer packages required
> - a `data.table` can be passed to functions expecting a `data.frame`
> - we will only scratch the surface today. Links to more resources are 
at the end of the lecture notes 

# slicing, column operations, and group by

## syntax: column selection and row filtering

> - `dplyr` syntax: depends on a small set of verbs
> - ~~verbs~~
> - `data.table` syntax: small set of consistent rules for interpreting input into `dt[]`
>- This set of rules can be most easily summarized as:
> `dt[i, j, by]`

  > - `i` filters rows
  > - `j` column operations
  > - `by` is group by
  
## exercise 

Using `data.table`'s special operator and what you learned about converting
datetimes in the previous session, convert the `datetime` column to a POSIX 
object. Then, create a new `data.table` that contains the total renewable energy generation (solar + wind) by hour and day. 
You will probably need lubridate's functions `day()` and `hour()`

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

generation_dt[, datetime := as_datetime(datetime)]

generation_dt[,.(solar_wind = solar + wind), by = .(day(datetime), hour(datetime))]

```

## clean up 

Columns can also be removed using `NULL`, similarly to base R:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

generation_dt[,solar_on := NULL]
generation_dt[,all_hydro := NULL]

```

There are several other `data.table` features, but these rules for syntax
cover lots of functionality

# `data.table` upgrades to other functions

## `data.table` upgrades to other functions

`data.table` co-opts some functions we've already talked about

> - `melt`
> - `dcast`
> - `merge`
> - `order`
> - _Note:_ sometimes loading `reshape` or `dplyr` will disrupt this behavior
and the original functions will be dispatched. To get around this, either 
call `merge.data.table` directly or don't load those packages.
> - This means we can repeat what we did this morning almost exactly

## exercise

Convert this `dplyr` syntax into `data.table` syntax (remember that this created
the columns `day`, `log_output`, and `per_output`)

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

long_ca_energy <- long_ca_energy %>%
  mutate(day = as_date(datetime),
         log_output = log(output)) %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  mutate(total_daily_output = sum(output, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(per_output = output/total_daily_output)

```

## exercise - answer
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

long_ca_energy <- long_ca_energy %>%
  mutate(day = as_date(datetime),
         log_output = log(output)) %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  mutate(total_daily_output = sum(output, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(per_output = output/total_daily_output)

# becomes
all_generation_long[,day := as_date(datetime)]
all_generation_long[,log_output := log(value)]
all_generation_long[,per_output := value/sum(value), by = day]
```
Note that this is possible to do in one command:
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

all_generation_long[,c("day2", "log_output2", "per_output2") := .(as_date(datetime), log(value), value/sum(value)), by = day]
# or
all_generation_long[,`:=`(day2 = as_date(datetime), 
                          log_output2 = log(value), 
                          per_output2 = value/sum(value)), 
                    by = day]

# can check this this resulted in correct values
all_generation_long[,all(day == day2)] # TRUE
all_generation_long[,all(per_output2 == per_output)] # TRUE

```
but how you prefer to write this depends on you. 

# a few bonus features

## fread

> - "Fast and friendly file finagler" - _help file_
> - "Similar to read.table but faster and more convenient" - _help file_
> - this is one of the most useful features of the `data.table` package, 
according to some

library(rbenchmark)

## special variables

`data.table`s also contain some special read-only symbols that are often useful: 

- `.N`: number of rows in the current group
- `.I`: a vector, `1:nrow(dt)`, usually used for more advanced operations

Here are some somewhat contrived examples of how to use them:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# for .N: convenient
all_generation_long[,.N] 
all_generation_long[,.N, by = type]

# for .I: more advanced syntax
all_generation_long[,.I]

```

## Other features: keys

- keys: one or more columns, pre-sorted index of the table.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# check the current key
key(generation_dt)

# set key
setkey(generation_dt, datetime)
key(generation_dt)

```

## Other features: joins

- joins: `data.table` has a special join syntax

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# this only works if at least one key is set
generation_dt[imports]

# this can also be used to select rows
fewer_imports <- imports[day(datetime) == 3 | day(datetime) == 4]
generation_dt[fewer_imports]

# operations can be performed in the same step as the merge
generation_dt[fewer_imports, sum(small_hydro + large_hydro), by = day(datetime)]

```

## Other features: `.SD`

- `.SD`: "subset of data"
- chunks off `data.table` by columns and groups.
