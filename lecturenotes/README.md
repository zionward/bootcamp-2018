## Lecture notes

The R sessions consist of presenter slides and accompanying exercises. These lecture notes are the general script for the sessions, and provide more extensive details. They serve as reference materials that you can choose to use either as you complete the exercises, if you've gotten behind in the workshop, or if you'd like to refresh your memory after the session.

For each part, there is an RMarkdown file (`*.Rmd`) that you can open in RStudio, or there is an html file you can view. Links to the HTML files for the easiest viewing are:
