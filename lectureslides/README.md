## Lecture slides

The R sessions consist of presenter slides and accompanying exercises. The files in this directory comprise the lecture slides used by the presenters. If you would like additional reference material, please see the lecture notes.

For each part, there is an RMarkdown file (`*.Rmd`) that you can open in RStudio, or there is an html file you can view if you would like to follow along. Links to the HTML files for the easiest viewing are:
